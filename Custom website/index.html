        <h1>Welcome To The Art of Huzz</h1>
        <p>“Basic principles: no woman wakes up saying, man, I hope I don’t get swept off my feet today!’ Now, she might
            say, ‘This is a really bad time for me,’ or something like, ‘I just need some space,’ or my personal
            favorite: ‘I’m really into my career right now.’ You believe that? Neither does she. You know why? Because
            she’s lying to you. That’s right. Lying. Because she doesn’t want to say, ‘I’m scared.’ She’s afraid of
            getting hurt again. She’s afraid of being vulnerable. And that’s where you come in.”
            — Hitch (2005)</p>
