        <h1>Welcome To The Art of Huzz</h1>
        <p>“Basic principles: no woman wakes up saying, man, I hope I don’t get swept off my feet today!’ Now, she might say, ‘This is a really bad time for me,’ or something like, ‘I just need some space,’ or my personal favorite: ‘I’m really into my career right now.’ You believe that? Neither does she. You know why? Because she’s lying to you. That’s right. Lying. Because she doesn’t want to say, ‘I’m scared.’ She’s afraid of getting hurt again. She’s afraid of being vulnerable. And that’s where you come in.”
— Hitch (2005)</p>

        <h2>Batteries Explained</h2>
        <p><strong>Battery cells</strong> are usually made up of three main components</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Anode (Negative Electrode)</li>
            <li>The Cathode (Positive Electrode)</li>
            <li>The electrolytes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>On a fully charged battery, the electrons pile up near negative end of the battery and when connected to a light bulb or circuit, the electrond move through the wires and back to the other end of the battery. This continues until the battery has no more electrons and then it is considered <em>dead</em>.</p>

            <dt>Secondary Batteries</dt>
            <dd>Secondary batteries are batteries with electrochemical cells whose chemical reactions can be reversed by charging them back up.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>There are several different kinds of batteries that you may have seen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The nickel-cadmium battery is a type of rechargeable battery which is developed using nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes</li>
            <li>The Lithium ion batteries are one of the most popular types of rechargeable batteries. They are found in different portable appliances including mobile phones, smart devices and several other battery appliances used at home. </li>
            <li>The lead-acid is the oldest type of rechargeable battery and still very relevant and important into today's world. This is the kind of battery that starts your car.</li>
