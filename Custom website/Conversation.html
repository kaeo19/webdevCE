        <h1>Welcome To The Art of Huzz</h1>
        <p>“Basic principles: no woman wakes up saying, ‘God, I hope I don’t get swept off my feet today!’ Now, she might say, ‘This is a really bad time for me,’ or something like, ‘I just need some space,’ or my personal favorite: ‘I’m really into my career right now.’ You believe that? Neither does she. You know why? Because she’s lying to you. That’s right. Lying. Because she doesn’t want to say, ‘I’m scared.’ She’s afraid of getting hurt again. She’s afraid of being vulnerable. And that’s where you come in.”
— Hitch (2005)</p>
