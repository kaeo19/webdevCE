        <h1>Welcome To The Art of Huzz</h1>
        <p>“Basic principles: no woman wakes up saying, ‘God, I hope I don’t get swept off my feet today!’ Now, she might say, ‘This is a really bad time for me,’ or something like, ‘I just need some space,’ or my personal favorite: ‘I’m really into my career right now.’ You believe that? Neither does she. You know why? Because she’s lying to you. That’s right. Lying. Because she doesn’t want to say, ‘I’m scared.’ She’s afraid of getting hurt again. She’s afraid of being vulnerable. And that’s where you come in.”
— Hitch (2005)</p>
        
        <h2>Motors</h2>
        <p>Electric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) intended to propel some external mechanism, such as a fan or an elevator. An electric motor is generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size.</p>
        
        <h2>Motors as Generators</h2>
        <p>In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors as seen in <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22132137/best-electric-bikes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">electric bikes</a>, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.</p>
        
        <h2>Batteries Explained</h2>
        <p><strong>Battery cells</strong> are usually made up of three main components</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Anode (Negative Electrode)</li>
            <li>The Cathode (Positive Electrode)</li>
            <li>The electrolytes</li>
        </ol>
